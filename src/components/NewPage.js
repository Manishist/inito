            <p>
<strong>Anovulation</strong> (having a menstrual cycle with no egg) is actually a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 10 women*.<br></br><br></br>
A sure way to confirm ovulation is a <strong>rise in Progesterone level</strong> after peak fertility. Progesterone also supports implantation and elevated levels of PdG during the 7-10 day window after ovulation correlates to higher chances of a successful pregnancy.</p><br></br>
